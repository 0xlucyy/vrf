Website's VRF Mechanism:
- A random number, `beta`, is generated using a VRF.
- The modulo of `beta` divided by the size of the revolver is hashed with a random key (`salt`) and published as part of the `newGame` transaction made by the bot.
- When the game ends, the bot sends the following as part of the `endGame` transaction:
   - `beta`: The randomly generated number in hex.
   - `salt`: The key concatenated with the modulo of `beta` and the revolver size before generating the SHA-256 hash.
   - `publickey`: The public key of the VRF.
   - `proof`: The generated proof for this specific random number.
   - `alpha`: The input message to the VRF, created as `UNIX time + [array of each player's bets]`.
- Each invocation of the VRF is provided with a seed, randomly generated by the bot. This seed doesn't need to be revealed for verification.
- Using `publickey`, `proof`, and `alpha`, anyone can verify that `beta` is the correct VRF hash. With `beta` verified, the modulo of it divided by the size of the revolver, concatenated with `salt`, generates a SHA-256 hash. This hash should match the one passed to `newGame`, proving that the bullet's chamber index was randomly generated at the start of the game.
